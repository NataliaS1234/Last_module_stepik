# Last_module_stepik
Hello my reviewer)
I didn't delete functions that we made during the module.
But as was asked - the necessary tests will be run with parameters "need_review".
Also I left some comments for me. Because I'm still learning and I'm afraid to forget some moments, that's why left some tips for future. Hope it won't be a problem for you.
